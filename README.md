- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pranjal Gupta. I'm a Data Scientist at SigTuple.
- ðŸ‘€ Recently, I've been applying Object Detection/Classification to detect the different types of white blood cells present in a Preipheral Blood Smear (PBS) image. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano which is a small, powerful supercomputer that can run multiple Neural Networks in parallel. My aim is to evaluate it and then judge whether it can be used in our diagnostic products to replace the current motherboard.
