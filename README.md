- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pranjal Gupta. I'm a Data Scientist at SigTuple.
- ðŸ‘€ Recently, I've been applying Object Detection/Classification to detect the different types of white blood cells present in a Preipheral Blood Smear (PBS) image. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Image Stitching using SIFT feature extraction to create Whole Slide Images (WSI) from multiple PBS images with vertical/horizontal overlap.
